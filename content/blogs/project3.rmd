# Climate change and temperature anomalies 

Aim: to analyse the the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected) throughout the past couple of decades. (Language: **R**)

The data can be found on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies we need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:


```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, #the real data table only starts in Row 2
           na = "***") # missing data is coded as "***" in the spreadsheet.  

head(weather)
```


For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

**First we select the related variables from the data set and then convert the data from wide format to long format to be able to create better graphs


```{r tidyweather}

#selecting the first 12 months and the year column
weather_12m <- weather%>%
  clean_names()%>%
  select(year, jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec)

#converting the dataset from wide to long
tidyweather <- weather_12m%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13,
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "delta") # delta is the temperature deviation

head(tidyweather)

```

We have three **variables** now:

1. **year**, 
2. *month**, and 
3. **delta**, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(year), month, "1")), #creating the date variable
         month = month(date, label=TRUE), #using the lubridate library, we take out the month from the date
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Producing a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line:

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

#Your code goes here...

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )+
  facet_wrap(~month) #in order to produce a seperate plot for each month


```
>TEAM ANSWER>

After breaking the data down into months it looks like for the most part the affect of increasing temperature is similar across the board. 

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

head(comparison)

```


Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

**How about yearly anomalies?** So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta,na.rm = TRUE)
            ) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=year, y= mean_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```
**So what?** 
We can conclude that the yearly data also proves that the temperature anomalies are almost exponential increasing. The governments should take immediate precautions to put an end to the  destruction of our planet by big corporations.
