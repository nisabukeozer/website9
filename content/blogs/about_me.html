<p>I was born in 1997 in <strong>Istanbul, Turkey</strong>. I grew up as a curious child and a fast learner. I got a full score in her national high school exam and attended <strong>Robert College</strong> which is a prestigious American high school in Istanbul. I discovered my curiosity for other cultures and passion for developing a global outlook during my time at my international high school. I also played at the school orchestra as <em>a drummer</em> and performed in several gigs. I was the <em>cool</em> girl. During my studies, I attended a part time music academy and managed to get <strong>London College of Music</strong> certificates for piano. I can now teach music as an <em>certified</em> piano teacher globally.</p>
<p>After graduation, I studied <strong>industrial engineering</strong> at Koc University, Istanbul. I discovered my love for data analytics when I took her first statistics class. During summers, I did analytics internships at <strong>Ford</strong> and <strong>Deloitte</strong> and gained professional insights in the analytics area. I completed my exchange semester at <strong>University of Warwick</strong> and decided to continue her graduate studies in the UK. Finally, I joined <strong>London Business School</strong> as a Masters student in <strong>Analytics and Management</strong>. I am especially looking forward to her <strong>Applied Statistics with R</strong> course. It is important to emphasize that I see myself as a well rounded person and has a <em>diverse</em> set of hobbies.</p>
<p>My favourite hobbies are as following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Playing the drums and the piano</p></li>
<li><p>Kayaking</p></li>
