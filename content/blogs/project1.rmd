**Aim:** Exploring whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is different via Hypothesis Testing. (Language: **R**)

*H0* = *there is no difference between the mean IMBD ratings of Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton* \
*H1* = *there is a difference between the mean IMBD ratings of Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton*


```{r picture, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/directors.jpg", error = FALSE)
```
First we need to load the data and take a look at its contents.
```{r}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies) 
```

Basic initial analysis to see how the mean ratings compare:
```{r}

#initial observation table:
 movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            mean = mean(rating),
            sd = sd(rating))  
```



**Comparing confidence intervals:**
```{r}
#creating a confidence interval
compare <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))   %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
   summarise(mean = round(mean(rating), 2),
              n = count(director),
              sd = sd(rating),
              t_critical = qt(0.975, n - 1),  #calculates the t-critical
              se = sd / sqrt(n),
              margin_of_error = t_critical * se,
              low_CI= round(mean - margin_of_error, 2) ,
              high_CI= round(mean + margin_of_error, 2)
              )%>%
  mutate(director = factor(director, levels = c("Tim Burton","Steven Spielberg")))

#graphing the confidence intervals
graph <- ggplot(compare, aes(colour=director)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = low_CI, xmax = high_CI, y= director), width = 0.1, size = 1.5)  +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("skyblue","tomato"))+
  geom_point(aes(x=mean, y=director), size = 3 ) +
  labs(title="Do Spielberg and Burton have the same IMDB ratings?",
       subtitle="95% confidence intervals overlap",
       x="Mean IMDB Rating",
       y =" ") +
  geom_text(aes(label = low_CI, x=low_CI, y=director), size = 4, color="black", hjust = 1, vjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.05, nudge_y = 0.08) +
  geom_text(aes(label = high_CI, x=high_CI, y=director),size = 4, color="black", hjust = 1, vjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.05, nudge_y = 0.08) +
  geom_text(aes(label = mean, mean, y=director), size = 6, color="black", hjust = 1, vjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.05, nudge_y = 0.08)+
geom_rect( mapping=aes(xmin= 7.27, xmax= 7.33, ymin=0, ymax=3), color="lightgrey", alpha=0.2) +
  theme_bw()
  
  
graph +theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

**T-test**
```{r}
compare2 <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) 

t.test(rating ~ director, data = compare2)
```

**Hypothesis testing**

```{r}

set.seed(1234)

obs_diff <- compare2 %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

obs_diff

#hypothesis testing with infer:

  null_dist_movies <- compare2 %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))
  
#visualise the null distribution 
null_dist_movies %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist_movies %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")


```

```{r}
null_dist_movies %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")
```

# Conclusion

According to the hypothesis testing, the p-value is smaller than 0.05 which means that it is safe to reject the null hypothesis that claims there is no difference in the mean ratings of Spielberg and Burton, which means that it is 95% likely that there is a difference between the mean ratings of these famous directors, and Spielberg is ahead of Burton in the IMDB race!
