title: About Nisa Ozer
---


I was born in 1997 in **Istanbul, Turkey**. I grew up as a curious child and a fast learner. I got a full score in her national high school exam and attended **Robert College** which is a prestigious American high school in Istanbul. I discovered my curiosity for other cultures and passion for developing a global outlook during my time at my international high school. I also played at the school orchestra as *a drummer* and performed in several gigs. I was the *cool* girl. During my studies, I attended a part time music academy  and managed to get **London College of Music** certificates for piano. I can now teach music as an *certified* piano teacher globally.

After graduation, I studied **industrial engineering** at Koc University, Istanbul. I discovered my love for data analytics when I took her first statistics class. During summers, I did analytics internships at **Ford** and **Deloitte** and gained professional insights in the analytics area. I completed my exchange semester at **University of Warwick** and decided to continue her graduate studies in the UK. Finally, I joined **London Business School** as a Masters student in **Analytics and Management**. I am especially looking forward to her **Applied Statistics with R** course. It is important to emphasize that I see myself as a well rounded person and has a *diverse* set of hobbies. 

My favourite hobbies are as following:

* Playing the drums and the piano

* Kayaking
